                <div class="message received">This TED talk from Lisa Feldman Barrett (University Distinguished Professor of Psychology at Northeastern University) explains how emotions are actually made.</div>
                <div class="message received">TED TALK: <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/lisa_feldman_barrett_you_aren_t_at_the_mercy_of_your_emotions_your_brain_creates_them?autoplay=true&muted=true" target="_blank" style="color:#007aff; text-decoration: underline;">Watch Here</a>.</div>
                <div class="message received">Emotions that seem to happen to you are actually made by you. Which means that you have more control over your emotions than you think you do.</div>
                <div class="message received">Your brain is wired so that if you change the ingredients that your brain uses to make emotions, then you can transform your emotional life.</div>
                <div class="message received">Professor Feldman Barrett calls this "being the architect of your experience".</div>

                <div class="message sent">Those changes won’t be visible from one day to another but it is still quite powerful to think that everything you’re doing today - the people you meet, the things you read, the movies you watch, and of course, the way you decide to react to every situation you face - will have an impact on how you will emotionally function in the future.</div>

                <div class="message received">Identify and label your emotions! Develop your emotional vocabulary by learning to identify and label your emotions.</div>
                <div class="message received">When you can name what you're feeling, it becomes easier to navigate and accept those emotions.</div>
                <div class="message received">Roller coaster of emotions (as long as it is not excessive) is actually good. It means you’re alive;
                    Emotions that seem to happen to you, are actually made by you…you are the architect of your experience. Putting a name on what you feel helps you accept those emotions.

                </div>
                <div class="message received">To conclude, I’ll leave you with this brilliant quote:</div>
                <div class="message received">“Perhaps it is best to think of it like this – most of us have come to terms with the fact that we are physically a collection of atoms. We and our consciousness somehow emerge and we seem to be able to live with this illusion of our being. Maybe all we need to do is the same for how we feel, as we play out our short existence.”
                    — William O'Connor - Head of Teaching and Research in Physiology, University of Limerick School of Medicine, Ireland.
